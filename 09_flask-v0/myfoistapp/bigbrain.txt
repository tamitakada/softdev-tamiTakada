0. I've only seen it before in Python...
1. You use '/' to separate directory and/or file names in the terminal and in urls.
2. This will probably print out in terminal, and it'll print the name of the file.
3. It will likely show up on the main web page, as it is returned from the main function that has the app route '/', which is probably the home page that will be displayed.
4. In Flutter, you would do runApp(App()) to run the app, which is a little similar.

Tina's observation: After running the app, I noticed that it gave you a URL to go to and it printed "No hablo queso!" which means "I don't speak cheese!" If the app wasn't actively running in the terminal, then the website would not be reached and you'd get an error.
