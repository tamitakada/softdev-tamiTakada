0. I've only seen it before in Python...
1. You use '/' to separate directory and/or file names in the terminal and in urls.
2. This will probably print out in terminal, and it'll print the name of the file.
3. It will likely show up on the main web page, as it is returned from the main function that has the app route '/', which is probably the home page that will be displayed.
4. In Flutter, you would do runApp(App()) to run the app, which is a little similar.
