New things:
- Importing request

Print statements print things to the terminal about the user who's accessing the site. 

Request arguments are a dictionary, and you can access the form values from the dictionary. The key is the name of the input in the form. The arguments are put in the URL.

When you submit the form, you're redirected to the /auth page, since the form action is defined as "/auth".
