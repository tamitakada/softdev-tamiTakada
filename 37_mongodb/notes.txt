- _id field can have a value other than ObjectId() if specified (as long as it's unique for every document)
- There's a schema validation functionality to force a specific structure for documents
- documents, by default, are inserted in the order that they are written in the array; this can be changed with ordered: false
- updateMany(query for documents to update, how to update)
- deleteOne/updateOne/findOne etc. are good if using _id field as query
