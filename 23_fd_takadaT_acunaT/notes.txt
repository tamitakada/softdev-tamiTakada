DISCO

- Foundation and Bootstrap have a lot of similarities
  - The nav bars both use unordered lists/list items
  - The "grid-x" in Foundation is 12 cells wide, which is the same as the Bootstrap column number
  - The "hide-for-size-only" in Foundation is similar to the breakpoint system in Bootstrap, and how you can choose the behavior of divs based on the screen size
  - The forms also look very similar, except there doesn't seem to be a "form-text" equivalent in Foundation

QCC

- Do these frameworks provide extra fonts?

Q0

- https://get.foundation/sites/docs/ (to look up buttons)

Q1

I prefer Bootstrap because though Foundation seems similar, I thought Bootstrap was easier to use. It's also easier to look up questions about Bootstrap since "foundation" is a common word.
