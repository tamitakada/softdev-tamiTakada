Questions:
	In team EAR, what does the seed valus of 42 mean and what role does it play in debugging?
	

Comments:
	Many groups used the same reading method of the file using the csv module. The main difference was either using DictReader, which reads input lines and converts each to a dictonary or just reading the file as a whole and parsing. 
	Generating the random number almost always was using a random number generator and the percentages given. Most used a range between (0,1000) and then found the weighted values through arithmetic. 
	
Concerns:
	Testing is definitely important to make sure code functions correctly and the user has a starting point.
