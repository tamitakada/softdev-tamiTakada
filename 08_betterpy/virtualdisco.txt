2021-09-30

Explanation:

The terminal segment "$ python3 -m venv ~/myherozero" specify a python virtual environment being created in a subdirectory called myherozero. 

python3 indicates that python is being used to establish the virtual environment. 
Virtual environments (venv) are isolated folders for packages. They're useful when creating multiple python projects, as different projects may need different versions of a package. Using virtual environments allows you to have a specific set of packages for each individual project. 
Finally, the ~/ means the environment will be in a sub directly of the home directory. 

Usage

Virtual environments have to be activated before they can be used.

Install: pip3 install virtualenv
Create an environment: virtualenv nameOfDirectory
Activate environment: source nameOfDirectory/bin/activate
Deactivate environment: deactivate
Install packages: pip3 install packageName
