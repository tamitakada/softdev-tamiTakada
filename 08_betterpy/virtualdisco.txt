Explanation

Virtual environments are isolated folders for packages. They're useful when creating multiple python projects, as different projects may need different versions of a package. Using virtual environments allows you to have a specific set of packages for each individual project. 

Usage

Virtual environments have to be activated before they can be used.

Install: pip3 install virtualenv
Create an environment: virtualenv nameOfDirectory
Activate environment: source nameOfDirectory/bin/activate
Deactivate environment: deactivate
Install packages: pip3 install packageName
