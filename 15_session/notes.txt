Summaries + Discoveries:

We used nested conditionals in app.py to handle different cases for the login.

We also used conditionals in the html response file to display different versions
of the page depending on the user inputs.

To make sure that the user stays logged in (on the welcome page), we use python
exception handling. If rendering response is successful, the user will be able to
return to the response page even if they exit out the page. However, if any part
goes wrong, which is to say if the user is not already successfully logged in, it
will only render login.

If user chooses to log out, we use the POST method, which signals app.py to remove
session data and render login page.

We use app.secret_key in order to use sessions and store session data. For our code,
a new secret_key is generated every time a session is opened.

Questions:
What exactly does app.secret_key do and what's its significance?
How can we use firefox console to its fullest potential?
